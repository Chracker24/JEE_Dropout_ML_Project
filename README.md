# 🚀 JEET : AI-Powered JEE and NEET Dropout After Class 12 Prediction app

## Overview

**JEET** is a Machine Learning project designed to predict the likelihood of students dropping out after Class 12, focusing on those preparing for or appearing in the Join Entrance Examination (JEE) and/or National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET) in India. By analysing academic and socio-economic data, JEET helps educators, counselors, and students to identify at-risk indivuiduals for timely intervention.

## Features ⭐
 - Predicts dropout risk using student academic and socio-economic data
 - Handles imbalanced data with SMOTE for better accuracy
 - User-friendly web app built with Streamlit
 - Enables educators and students to take data-driiven actions

## Dataset 📖
includes features such as 
 - Academic scores (Class 10, Class 12, JEE/NEET scores)
 - Attendance records
 - Socio-economic factors (family income, parent's education)
 - Target Labele: dropout status (Yes/No)

## Installation 🖥️
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com//Chracker24/JEE_Dropout_ML_Project.git
cd JEE_Dropout_ML_Project
```
### 2. **(Optional)** Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   #MacOS: venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🔨
1. Navigate to Home.py in 06_deployment
2. Run the Streamlit application using Bash
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```
3. Input stuudent details via the web interface to get dropout risk predictions
4. Talk with Google Gemini powered JEET chatbot about your shortcomings and help 

## Methodology 💭
 - Data Cleaning, encoding cateogorical variables, and feature scaling and engineering
 - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
 - Trained Random Forest Classifier as the main model
 - Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and ROC-AUC 
 - used SHAP for model interpretability

## Results ✨
 - Achieved approximately **67%** accuracy
  - This is due to presence of leaky data that got removed and will be fixed in later iterations with better data
 - Nonetheless, Improved recall with data balancing
 - Important predictors : socio-economic status, peer pressure and mental health

## Future work and iterations 🤖
 - Incorporate psychological and motivational data
 - Explore advanced models (XGBoost, deep learning)
 - Add personalized intervention suggestions
 - Expand dataset for broader applicability and fix leaky data situation

## Tech Stack 💽
 - Python, scikit-learn
 - imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, Pipeline)
 - pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
 - SHAP (Interpretabiility)
 - Streamlit (deployment)

Project Plan: JEE Dropout Prediction & Support Tool (FULL STRATEGY)
________________________________________
📅 Timeline: July 9 – September 15, 2025
Goal: Build and deploy a smart, emotionally aware, ML-powered web app that predicts JEE dropout risk and delivers personalized advice to students — demo-ready for your school and impactful for your portfolio.
________________________________________
🧱 PHASE 1: ML Model Development (July 9–20)
✅ Objectives:
•	Clean and preprocess dataset
•	Engineer meaningful features (not just raw inputs)
•	Train and evaluate 3–4 core ML models
🧠 Feature Engineering Plan:
•	Convert binary mental_health_issues to a custom `` (0–10)
o	Ask 3–4 simple yes/no questions to calculate it
•	Add ,, and `` the same way
•	Normalize/scale numeric features (study hours, scores)
🔨 Models to Train:
1.	Logistic Regression – interpretable and a strong baseline
2.	Decision Tree Classifier – visual logic, easy to explain
3.	Random Forest Classifier – more robust ensemble version
4.	XGBoost Classifier – high-performance gradient boosting
5.	Optional: Support Vector Machine (SVM) – linear baseline for comparison
Each model will be evaluated and compared based on performance and interpretability.
•	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
•	Use classification_report and confusion_matrix
•	Save final model + encoders using joblib

🏢 PHASE 2: Backend API with ChatGPT (July 21–30)
✅ Goals:
•	Create a backend that:
o	Loads the saved model
o	Accepts JSON student data
o	Returns: dropout probability + GPT-powered advice
🔧 Tech Stack:
•	Framework: Flask or FastAPI
•	ML Serving: joblib model, consistent input processing
•	GPT API: openai.ChatCompletion.create() with prompts like:
"A student has a dropout probability of 0.82. Their top issues are: low study hours, high peer pressure, and high parental pressure. Write advice in the tone of a funny, emotionally-aware senior who gets it."
🔐 API Routes:
•	/predict → returns dropout score + human-style advice
•	Optional: /health for uptime monitoring

🎨 PHASE 3: Frontend UI (July 31 – Aug 11)
✅ Goals:
•	Build a clean, mobile-friendly frontend form
•	Send data to backend → receive prediction + advice
💻 Frontend Stack:
•	Vercel (deployment)
•	Tailwind CSS (responsive design)
•	Optional: React or plain HTML+JS
🎯 Key Features:
•	Inputs: study hours, JEE scores, pressure levels, etc.
•	Shows risk score (e.g. 76%) + GPT advice
•	Visual risk indicator (color bar, emoji, etc.)
________________________________________
🚀 PHASE 4: Deployment + School Demo Prep (Aug 12–25)
✅ Deployment Plan:
•	Frontend: Vercel (100% free)
•	Backend: Render or Railway (free with sleep timeout)
•	Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping /health every 5 mins and keep backend awake
✅ Demo Strategy:
•	Create short domain or Vercel subdomain
•	Generate QR code + poster (optional)
•	Drop link in school WhatsApp groups
o	Include: short caption, disclaimer, value prop

💡 STRETCH GOALS (Optional but Impressive)
•	SHAP plots for feature impact
•	Multilingual GPT output (Hindi, Malayalam, etc.)
•	Save anonymized data for feedback
•	Blog post explaining problem, solution, and ML pipeline
________________________________________
🔐 ETHICAL NOTE
•	Inform users: AI advice is not medical advice
•	Display disclaimer: “This is a free educational tool. For serious mental health concerns, consult a professional.”

🧠 FINAL MESSAGE
This isn’t just ML — it’s impact. It’s design. It’s empathy through code.
“If one scared student decides to pause, reflect, and make a healthier choice — you didn’t build an app, you built a life raft.”
You’ve got 2 months. Let’s build this, launch it, and walk into your old school like the dropout whisperer you were born to be.
